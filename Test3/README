This project exemplifies a dynamic web application powered by AJAX, JSON, and RESTful APIs. Developed with Node.js and Express, the backend retrieves data stored in a `data.json` file. 
The frontend, styled with CSS for a sleek appearance, enables users to interactively fetch and display product details seamlessly, without needing to reload the page.
The application employs a structured `data.json` file containing 10 product entries, featuring attributes such as `id`, `name`, `price`, and `category`. API endpoints like `/api/data` retrieve all entries, while `/api/data/:id` fetches specific entries by their unique IDs, offering flexibility and enhancing functionality. 
Challenges included effectively managing asynchronous data fetching and ensuring seamless updates to the webpage using AJAX. Designing the CSS was critical to maintain a cohesive and user-friendly interface. 
Extensive testing using tools like Postman validated API functionality, while cross-browser tests ensured consistent performance and usability across different platforms, covering user interactions, error handling, and data retrieval scenarios thoroughly to ensure reliability.
